    ; At this point, we did a shortcut by making one comparison statement and let it jump based from the CMP return.

; For every "__GUESS_<CONDITION>", it jumps to that instruction to display a string and JMP based from the ff condition/s:
; 1. If Equal (EQ), then display "you guessed it right!" and terminate the program.
; 2. If Less than (LT) or Greater than (GT), then display either "make it lower" or "make it higher"
; And jump to __DRY_DISP_THEN_JUMP process to do the anti-redundant execution and jump to __ASM__ENTRYPOINT.
