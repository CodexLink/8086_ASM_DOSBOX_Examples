# Welcome

This repository contains all of my activities and exercises taken from one of my courses (see the names on the sub title above). It was **dumped** to ensure that further review from this field and scope is **reviewable** without problems.

***In short***, I want to dump my deliverables somewhere open so that other fellow students who take up this course can find learning materials (**not a cheating material!!!**) for them to learn. If you ever get doubt at learning at this, then try looking at this repository where each **.ASM** has its comments (my insights).

## Pre-requisites

The following list is a set of things you need to get up and running.

1. An IDE or Text Editor (I'm using Visual Studio Code)
2. DOSBox
3. TASM
4. TLINK

### Note

There's no indicator which version is better or optimal. Please follow the instructions of your professor.

## Running

Here's my snippet of what I have in my DOSBox Startup Configuration.

```text
MOUNT <ANY_DRIVE_LETTER> <FOLDER>
<ANY_DRIVE_LETTER>:

TASM <PROGRAM_NAME_WO_EXTENSION>
TLINK /T <PROGRAM_NAME_WO_EXTENSION>
<PROGRAM_NAME_WO_EXTENSION>
```

### Reminder

1. The **first 2 is optional**. The last **3 is required**.
2. It is pretty obvious that you should change the contents inside "<>" but without "<>" literally.
3. Keep in mind that, this is my way of launching my ASM programs, because, I mainly debug them and once they are okay. I'm gonna close it and call it a day.

## Filenames and Output

The following is a list of filenames along with it's description and their output. It will be long list, please check the [media folder](https://github.com/CodexLink/8086_ASM_DOSBOX_Examples/tree/main/media) for the overview of those picture. Or click the images per row to see the exact output.

### Note(s)

1. The filenames are **8-letters long**. Anything more than 8 will make the **DOSBOX complain that it can't find it**.(2) asd
2. Most of the operations such as ***Adding*** and ***Subtracting*** a Number may require the use of ```/T``` when linking with ```TLINK.exe```. Please double check if ```TLINK``` is complaining about the stack being non-existent or otherwise.
3. With that being said, please try ```/T``` if the program won't run. The evaluation of needing ```/T``` is purely based from assumption without running them and carefully evaluating it.
4. There are atleast **1-2 activities** that didn't make it to the open-source. This is because those activities are: (a) too basic, (b) potentially renders someone unable to learn. and, (c) too complex to be provided and taken away. I have this one activity that has the capacity to drain my **dignity for about 12 hours**, I'll never forget that.

## Why would I do this?

When there's a course that can't be taught professionally (in the means of **teaching them** with **further knowledge** about it), I would go initiate **self-learning mode** then proceed to ***ignore their teachings*** (they teach what's the basics and then proceed to have us learn the hard ropes because why not, it's a money grab anyway).

## Disclosure

Whenever you clone this repository and take action on any part of this material, you are putting yourself in a responsibility where you can't blame and risk someone else (like me) for getting yourself caught cheating or otherwise.

I only provide materials in a fashion where I want to distribute them because I used other resources. If these materials are the exact thing that shows in your deliverables, **please learn instead** of ***copying them*** straight up from someone else.

With the fact of typical students stealing, please if possible, **credit**. There would be no issues whenever you do it or now either way; just give some appreciation at least.

## Credits

I would like to **thank all** of the authors that has a question that exists in the internet, people who provides pdfs and articles without shutting their servers down, extensions who extend the capabilities of my text editor, providers of **TASM**, **DEBUGX** and **TLINK** compiled programs, and other people who became the part of my self-learning experience of this course. Some links provided below are the once I can honorly mention because of my utilization to their programs / extensions / etc:
